# Combative-cases-Colombia-history
This is an overview about Colombian War over the years.


We are going to make a brief descriptive analysis about War cases in Colombia using data from Centro Nacional de Memoria Historica at the same country.
We used data from El conflicto Armado en Cifras, more specifically Acciones BÃ©licas to give a general picture about War en Colombia.

All this analysis was made using Power BI as software visualization.
